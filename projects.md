### Software projects

#### [gmx2qmmm](https://github.com/gmx2qmmm/gmx2qmmm_portable)—a python interface for Quantum mechanics/Molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculation

`gmx2qmmm` is a python package to bridge Gaussian and Gromacs. The test runs were performed using Gaussian16 and Gromacs 5.0.2, but the code should be able to read earlier Gaussian and other Gromacs versions. The only limits are the formats of the human-readable input and output files of each program, as such, conversion scripts can be written to make the interface work with any version, if the current code does not support it. Conceptually, gmx2qmmm creates a QM/MM potential and performs either single point calculations (i.e., the current energy of your system) or geometry optimizations. (Other ultilities are ongoing)

### Research projects


#### Master thesis : _Interfaces between quantum chemistry and force field programs_

Jointly designed a python package gmx2qmmm, which links quantum mechanics software and molecular mechanics software to perform a quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculation. Especially worked on tests of energies and forces output with different bio-molecules. More utilities implementation are ongoing.

#### Master internship project :  _Ground and excited state properties of pyrene, azapyrene, diazapyrene and derivatives_

Used density functional theory (DFT) calculation with different functionals to observe nitrogen substitution effect on pyrene and its derivatives and analyzing the ground and excited state properties.

#### _Mechanical System Design and Practice_

Designed functions oriented robot including mechanism and control system with limited budget. The robot participated _2015 Mechanical System Design and Practice Competetion_ at the mechanical faculty in National Taiwan University and Science and Technology. The robot was able to move, collect tennis ball and shoot the required target. Our team won **Honorable Mention / Best Creative Award**.
