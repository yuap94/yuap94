## Projects

### Software projects

- [gmx2qmmm](https://github.com/gmx2qmmm/gmx2qmmm_portable)—a python interface for Quantum mechanics/Molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculation

### Other projects


### Master thesis : [_Interfaces between quantum chemistry and force field programs_](https://github.com/yuap94/yuap94/blob/gh-pages/pdf/Master_thesis.pdf)

Jointly designed a python package gmx2qmmm, which links quantum mechanics software and molecular mechanics software to perform a quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculation. Especially worked on tests of energies and forces output with different bio-molecules. More utilities implementation are ongoing.

### Master internship project :  [_Ground and excited state properties of pyrene, azapyrene, diazapyrene and derivatives](https://github.com/yuap94/yuap94/blob/gh-pages/pdf/Internship_neu.pdf)


### Bachelor project : _TDK Robocon_ <!-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_iUjzjunIo-->

Designed functions oriented robot including mechanism and control system, to participate 19th TDK competition and earned Judges’ Award. The robot includes moving, gripping pen and ball, writing characters and shooting ball motions.

### Bachelor research project :[_Low-cost flowmeter_](https://github.com/yuap94/yuap94/blob/gh-pages/pdf/Internship_neu.pdf)

Jointly conceptualized, designed and developed this project with peers from Munich University of Applied Sciences, Germany. Designed mechanism and control system to measure flow rate with cheap material and display data through different program interfaces.

### Bachelor research project : _Wind turbine Generator implementation iPBL (international Project-Based Learning)_

Jointly developed this project with peers from Osaka Institute of Science and technology, Japan. Designed high efficiency blades, aerodynamic compressing lens and supporting structure to improve the efficiency of the wind turbine power and output with 3D printing.
